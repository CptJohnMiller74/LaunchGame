# LaunchGame

The object of the game is to launch the bird as far as possible. The player loses speed when hitting the ground or a normal enemy rather than a special enemy and bounces significantly less. The player can use boosts while in the air that apply a downward force, resulting in a higher bounce and losing less speed on a collision. Boosts are recharged after colliding with five enemies and that progress is shown onscreen. There are three types of enemies: a standard one, one with a bomb that bounces the player higher, and a flying one, which comes in pairs, that awards the player with a full boost on a collision. There is also a truck that when collided with, allows the player to travel a certain distance, hitting all enemies in its way and giving a speed boost at the end. Upon hitting an enemy, the player is awarded money which they can use to buy upgrades that allow them to travel farther. These include a higher maximum number of boosts, a higher launch force, a smaller speed penalty when hitting the ground and normal enemies, and a higher frequency of special enemies/the truck. All of the player's upgrades, money, and high score are saved locally.

***NOTE***
The store is currently a work in progress. I needed to make a deadline, so I needed to throw something together quickly. I am currently in the process of making it look better.
